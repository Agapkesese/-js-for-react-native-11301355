DCIT 202 Assignment 

The processArray function takes an array of numbers as an argument.
It uses the map method to iterate over each element in the array:
If the element is even (x % 2 === 0), it squares the element (x ** 2).
If the element is odd, it triples the element (x * 3).
The transformed array is returned.
An example usage is provided to demonstrate how to use the function.
The module.exports = processArray; line allows the function to be exported for use in other files, making it modular.
